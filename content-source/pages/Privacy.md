# Privacy 

This is my personal website, it's not a business or a marketing exercise so I have no real need to know anything about you. I also respect your privacy and your right to stay anonymous if you choose.  
For this reason, I've chosen to do what I reasonably can to a avoid exposing your personal details and data. The measures I have (or in some cases haven't) include:

* Not using Cookies anywhere on the site
* Not storing anything in your Browser localStorage
* Not logging anything personally identifiable in server error or access logs (* more on access logging below)
* Not using a CDN (many "free" CDN accounts are effectively paid for via stats collection - some more reputably than others)
* Not using any analytics services
* Ensuring your web page requests and responses are encrypted via well-configured HTTPS


In short, I will honour your right to privacy as if it were my own.
