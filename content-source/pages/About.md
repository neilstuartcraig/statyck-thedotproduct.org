# About

Hello, I'm Neil Craig and I work at the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) as Lead Technical Architect in the Online Technology Group (OTG). OTG is responsible for many of the shared core services of BBC Online such as DNS, traffic management, CDN's and media distribution. The team I work in also provides technical consultancy to many of the other teams throughout BBC online.

Some of the tech I work with regularly includes:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* Git ([Github](https:www.github.com))
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [Node](https://www.nodejs.org) - in a [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (ish, i really dislike OO & state) style
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) CI
* [NGINX](https://nginx.org)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) & TLS
* [http/2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)
* [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)
* [k6](https://loadimpact.com/k6/)
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
* Several of the leading commercial CDNs and our in-house media delivery CDN
* Security and privacy on the internet
* Web browsers (WRT features, changes, bugs etc.)


I've also got some interests in some things I don't use as frequently and/or necessarily know too well yet, for example:

* [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic) (if you're on an enabled Chrome browser, you might be reading this via QUIC)
* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) web server
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) & containers in general

Outside of work, I like to spend time with my Wife, Children & family, build/fix/improve things around the house, snowboard, skateboard, mountain bike, play football, listen to some good reggae/ska/dub/rocksteady/roots and occasionally I find time to go have a beer with some friends at a good pub. I live in [the 'shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire). If you want to know anything else, feel free to [contact me](/contact.html).
