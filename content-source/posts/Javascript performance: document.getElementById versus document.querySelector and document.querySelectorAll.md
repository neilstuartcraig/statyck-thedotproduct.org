<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be working on an internal project the last few weeks which has a known set of modern browsers as the target audience. This means i&#8217;ve been able to ignore some of the older design/development issues.</p>
<p>I am really liking <strong>document.querySelector</strong> and <strong>document.querySelectorAll</strong> which are relatively modern (well, to me at least) as they&#8217;re so convenient to use. This did make me wonder what their performance would be like though, typically convenience is inversely proportional to performance so i thought i&#8217;d put together a quick test on jsperf.com;</p>
<p><a href="http://jsperf.com/document-getelementbyid-versus-document-queryselector" target="_blank">http://jsperf.com/document-getelementbyid-versus-document-queryselector</a></p>
<p>The results vary in scale by browser but the overall trend is that <strong>document.getElementById</strong> is much faster than <strong>document.querySelector</strong> which is in turn a fair amount faster than <strong>document.querySelectorAll</strong> (which is probably a more obvious outcome).</p>
<p>So there you have it! Use document.getelementById wherever you can and only use document.querySelectorAll if you defintely need to locate multiple elements.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Just tested on Opera 12.11 (OSX) and bizarrely, it&#8217;s faster at document.querySelectorAll. Overall though Opera is a great deal slower in this test case than Chrome/Firefox. Safari 6 on OSX is immensely fast for document.getElementByID</p>
