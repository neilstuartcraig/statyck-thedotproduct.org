<p>Since the <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/" target="_blank">original Lightbox</a> was released by <a href="http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/" target="_blank">Lokesh Dhakar</a> many moons ago, we&#8217;ve all been fascinated with it&#8217;s JavaScript trickery. Those of us who are Web-Developers working with/for Design Agencies will no doubt be very familiar with many subsequent, similar JavaScripts such as <a href="http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox" target="_blank">Slimbox</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried out a fair number of MooTools compatible Lightbox clones/improvements and have found the one I like best to be <a href="http://www.phatfusion.net/plugins/multibox/" target="_blank">Multibox</a> by <a href="http://www.phatfusion.net/" target="_blank">PhatFusion</a>. The only problem being, it seemed to be abandoned for a long time and this meant it didn&#8217;t work with MooTools 1.2 which caused me problems. I therefore hacked MultiBox and Overlay.js for my own personal use, making a few improvements along the way and was going to release it for the benefit of others&#8230;Then I found that <a href="http://www.liamsmart.co.uk/" target="_blank">Liam Smart</a> had done it and to be honest, done a better job of it that I did. So, if you use MooTools and need a multimedia-capable JavaScript/Fancy display widget, you&#8217;d be wise to check out <a href="http://www.liamsmart.co.uk/Downloads/multiBox/" target="_blank">MultiBox for MooTools 1.2</a>.</p>
