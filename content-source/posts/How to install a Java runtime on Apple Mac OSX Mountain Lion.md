<p>One of the (perhaps) understandable but more irritating aspects of Apple Mac OSX upgrades which I just experienced is the fact that my upgrade from lion to mountain lion is that the Java runtime (JRE) is uninstalled&#8230;This meant that my usual code editor/IDE <a href="http://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans</a> was broken &#8211; not good!</p>
<p>So i searched around and found some installers e.g. from Oracle but I couldn&#8217;t be 100% sure they were going to work. Experience tells me that I should be careful installing JRE&#8217;s as broken installs can be a real pig to fix.</p>
<p>So I thought I&#8217;d just double check that my JRE was definitely removed by launching a terminal and typing &#8220;java -v&#8221; (which actually seems to be incorrect but was a guess) and luckily enough, OSX detected that I wanted a JRE and offered to download it for me. The install worked as far as I can tell and Netbeans is now working, bonus!</p>
<p>Just thought that might help someone out and save some time messing around.</p>
